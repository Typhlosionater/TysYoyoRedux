[h1]~ Ty's Yoyo Redux ~[h1]

Ty's Yoyo Redux is a small mod made to expand on the vanilla yoyo experience. It is a part vanilla tweaks, part small content mod made to improve using yoyos in various ways, this includes:
[list]
 [*]Gives unique effects to all the vanilla yoyos (except the Terrarian and Wooden Yoyo). Rally now leaves damaging afterimages, Chik randomly sprays crystal shards, and Kraken lashes out with damaging tentacles when it hits an enemy
 [*]Progression-appropriate recipes for the developer yoyos to make them easier to obtain
 [*]New yoyos at various points in progression to help smooth yoyo progression and add new options. Asteroid is a fireball launching meteorite yoyo, Holy Throw is an exceptionally agile yoyo that pierces armour and is crafted from hallowed bars, and Extraterrestrial Taser is a yoyo obtainable from the martian madness that electrocutes enemies with lingering electrospheres
 [*]New yoyo specific accessories to give more variety to a yoyo playthrough, along with providing a more viable endgame yoyo accessory
 [*]Improves counterweights by speeding up their movement speed and making them use local immunity frames, along with making them switch out after a short time
 [*]Entirely configurable!

~ Ty's Yoyo Redux ~

Ty's Yoyo Redux is a small mod made to expand on the vanilla yoyo experience. It is a part vanilla tweaks, part small content mod made to improve using yoyos in various ways, this includes:

 - Giving unique effects to all the vanilla yoyos (except the Terrarian and Wooden Yoyo) such as Rally leaving damaging afterimages, Chik randomly spraying crystal shards and Kraken lashing out with damaging tentacles when it hits an enemy.
 - Progression appropriate recipies for the developer yoyos to make them easier to obtain in a playthrough.
 - New yoyos at various points in progression to help smooth yoyo progression and add options such as Asteroid which is a fireball launching meteorite themed yoyo, Holy Throw which is an exceptionally agile yoyo that ignores 10 enemy armour crafted from hallowed bars and Extraterrestrial Taser a yoyo obtainable from the martian madness that electrocutes enemies with lingering electrospheres.
 - New yoyo specific acessories to give more variety to a yoyo playthrough along with providing a more viable engame yoyo accessory.
 - Improves counterweights by speeding up their movement speed and making them use local immunity frames along with making them switch out after a short time.

In addition, all of these features can be enabled or disabled via the internal config to fit the mod to your liking.

Contents:

 - 18 Effects for vanilla yoyos and descriptions for those yoyos.
 - 2 Recipies added for developer yoyos.
